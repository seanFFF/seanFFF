                    </p>



                    <p>


                    <p>1.As I was taking on p5js code for the first time, I was very new to the website I was about to
                        create and I searched through a lot of tutorials on yutube and decided to create a website with
                        particle dissipation effects in code.</p>
                    <p>2.When choosing an image I chose a font image I had made about RMIT Creative Coding
                        Specialisation</p>
                    <div class="1234">
                        <img src="seanFFF/img/rmit1.jpg" height="200" width="205">


                    </div>

                    <p>3.However, I realised that the tutorials I had found on yutube were in processing code, so I
                        searched a lot about processing and learnt that the code in processing could be converted to
                        p5js code, so I decided to start creating the website in processing code first.</p>

                    <p>Here's a screenshot of my code</p>
                    <div class="12345"><img src="seanFFF/img/taylor code.png" height="430" width="330">
                    </div>


                    <p>basically this string of code is capturing pixel points on the
                        image and drawing them elsewhere in the image.
                        So I first get the coordinates and colour of each pixel point in the image to get the value of
                        the pixel array in the image. After that I set the offset data for each pixel point, (using
                        Gaussian random to make the pixel points float randomly), and finally add (startX=mouseX) to
                        make the pixel points change their float position with mouse movement. This basically completes
                        the page.</p>

                    <p>Here is the final result, I recorded a video and I am very happy with the result.</p>
                    <div class="h123">
                        <video src="seanFFF/img/rmit1.mp4" height="500" width="800" autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop"
                            muted="muted"></video>

                    </div>
                    <p>I then searched the internet for a lot of information on converting processing code to p5js and
                        did a lengthy code conversion but it ultimately failed, so I gave up on this as the final
                        product of the assignment and treated it as a little exploration</p>
